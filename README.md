loginwithoutloginpage
=====================
This is an interesting small application developed by Debadatta Mishra to know the power of Spring Framework.
In this application we are providing a security screen ie logi to go into the application but actually there is no login page.
The login page is already there in Spring Security. We are just using the built-in feature.
